                Thank you for the support for this blog! We have been loving documenting our journey. It is lovely to hear from family and friends who have received the words we're

                We are writing this month's entry from Taroudant, Morocco - we made it! We are reunited and are now back on the bikes together in this beautiful country. 
                A final sprint to Tarifa, and before we knew it we were in the Sahara desert pasting together mud bricks with mud.

                We are publishing this post late this month! We had a heap of unwanted admin at the time we would have wanted to be writing. Unfortunately the Swedish embassy has 
                rejected our tourist visa application which would allow us to cycle from Morocco to Sweden and stay there for Rob and Kayleigh’s wedding. The journey will take us 
                3 months which is the longest we can spend in the Schengen Zone without a visa. Brexit, Brexit, Brexit. We were given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the 
                Swedish Migration Court. We want to thank Kayleigh, Mahnaz, Jafar, Mona, Linda, Amanda, and Iz’s dad all for helping us compile the evidence to give the best case for 
                the appeal. All the documents have been sent off now - all we can do is wait and see!

            <p id="p_blog" class="mt-4">
                This time last month I was writing this blog from Nick's luxurious apartment. Intending to spend only two days there, this became n+1 days 
                (where n is the number of days I had already spent). I had tried to line up a Warm Showers stop off where I could spend my birthday later that week. 
                No positive responses returned. As swished about in the apartment's swimming pool under a warm sun, the radical thought came to me: why don't I just stay 
                for the entire week?

            <p id="p_blog" class="mt-4">
                I did everything I wanted to on the day - I joined a surfing lesson in the morning, had two swims (one in the sea, one in the swimming pool), a massage 
                (many thanks to Rob and Kayleigh for this present!), and dinner for one out at an Indian (when in Portugal you know…!), and time to chill, read, and call family 
                in between.

            We had aimed to arrive in Morocco at the beginning of February. Due to the 90 day Schengen shuffle I wanted to stick to schedule. I had eeked out my time 
            in Portuguese paradise to the very limit I could still feasibly get to Tarifa for the 1st February. Having spent a week relaxing, I was in the best state 
            possible to tackle the challenge: four consecutive days of over 100km. The evening of my birthday I scrubbed the nerve-wrackingly white apartment from top 
            to bottom, and got myself ready to go for an early start the next day.

                    By midafternoon after leaving Vilamoura I made it to the border of Portugal, Vila Real de Santo António. Waiting for the small ferry crossing was the second 
                    time I had stepped off the bike all day: I discovered I could eat bananas whilst still gliding along flat roads. Nonetheless I put the waiting time to good use 
                    by cracking out my stove to get some rice on the boil, much to the amusement of the German campavaners who took this photo.

                    Back in Spain again, I was determined to reach my target mileage before setting up camp. My route through the mudflats under the setting sun was beautiful, 
                    but didn't lend itself to efficient cycling. Little did I know what was in store for me the next day.

                    keep the bike upright and moving. As more and more obstacles emerged, I started wondering if I had been signed up to some kind of entertainment show without my 
                    realising: watch how far this cyclist will go along this unrideable track until they give up. I sank thigh deep into unavoidable puddles, lifted my 50kg+ bike over 
                    boulders in my cleated shoes, squeezed myself and the bike through an extensive tight knit crop of bamboo, and any time in between was a heavy fight to push the bike 
                    through deep sand. Finally I admitted defeat at an enormous fallen tree trunk and after which the track (if it could still be called as such) couldn't be seen with 
                    the best of my imagination.

                    Going back even a short distance feels harder sometimes than the toughest of surfaces going forwards. The closest escape route was a highway bridge back through 
                    the bamboo plantation. I surveyed the four “routes” up onto the highway from the bottom of the bridge where I was, and selected the least unfeasible. It took three 
                    trips to get the luggage and the bike (which I carried on my shoulder so I could use my hands for climbing) up to the road. Catching my breath, I stopped to take 
                    breakfast sitting on a manhole cover behind the crash barrier. With record breaking slowness, I had travelled 5km in 1 hour 15 minutes. It was still early. 
                    The time spent could have felt like a waste, but I was grateful I had set off when I did.

                    My route following this was a compromise and still involved deep and long sandpits. I reached Huelva at midday and stopped to review the route ahead. To my horror, 
                    I saw ahead was a 30km sandy beach to cross. Comments on Komoot described this as the hardest section of cycling a cycletourer had ever taken. They warned me this 
                    route could only be taken at low tide, and you cannot stop to rest since the rising tide could leave you stranded. Already scarred by the experience of the morning, 
                    I scrabbled for a road ride alternative. Komoot provided one, to my relief, and I continued along the long road through the Doñana National Park towards Matalascañas. 
                    After this town the road Komoot suggested would not exist, but this did not matter as I would never get so far.

                <p id="p_blog">
                    Trying to make up for lost time from the slow morning, I pedaled to my maximum capacity. I was making PBs and seeing if I could cover each 5km in less time than the 
                    last. The long straight road lined with high fences, the same species of trees and shrubs, had the feeling of being in a never ending repeating loop. I stopped to 
                    rest after 35km of this. Restarting, I immediately knew something was wrong. Sure enough my back tyre was deflating - the first puncture I have had in years. 
                    The moment had finally come to use my spare inner tubes I had carried all the way from England. I set to work removing the faulty one and got out the replacement. 
                    Again, I knew something was wrong. The valve was too big and wouldn't fit into my wheel (it was a Schrader rather than a Presta valve for anyone interested. 
                    I'm embarrassed by this mistake to be honest!). 
                </p>
                <p id="p_blog">
                    Of course when I check my second spare it is exactly the same. No problem, I thought: Let's set about mending the puncture on the original inner tube.
                </p>
                <p id="p_blog">
                    A side note on slime inner tubes (again for anyone interested) - I'm not convinced. Sure, it has lasted two years without a flat tyre. But once it's popped, 
                    no amount of mopping was stopping the gunk oozing out of the puncture making it impossible to stick a patch on.

                        Without a functioning rear inner tube, my bike was unrideable. The closest settlement, Matalascañas, was far out of walking distance 20km away, and besides 
                        didn't have a bike shop. My heart sank as I realised I would need to get a lift. The closest bike shop further along my route was in Sanlúcar de Barrameda was 
                        50km by bike. By car it would be a 205km journey: since the road ends at Matalascañas, the only way is to make a long diversion via Seville. For second time that 
                        day I decided to go back the way I came, 35km back to Huelva.

                        the long spit of land hosting Europe's longest beach at Comporta. Now I am in off peak tourist central of the Algarve, long flat sandy beaches lined with bars, 
                        restaurants, and British tourists sporting January sun burns.

                        The following events made me feel so grateful to have had the puncture. I waited on the other side of the road: very few vehicles passed and the ones which 
                        did ignored my waving. Eventually a car stopped and I tried to explain in elementary Spanish my situation to the couple. They were going to Huelva and very 
                        kindly gave me, my bike, and all the luggage a lift with them. As we drove I watched all the miles I had cycled fly past. Rocio asked me where I had planned 
                        to sleep: I explained I had a tent and would find somewhere to go after collecting a new inner tube. She asked if I would like to stay with them in Matalascañas. 
                        Absolutely! Yes please! Thank you! I felt overjoyed. I had gone from rags to riches the space of 5 minutes. I will always be so grateful to Juan and Rocio!

            Despite Juan having an audition to go to they drove around the city to find a bike shop for me. Rocio, who works as an intensive care nurse, 
            had an early start for her 12 hour shift the next morning so I slept in her brother's house - he was away but their sister, Anna, lived next door. 
            Anna and I shared breakfast together the next morning (avocado on toast!). We chatted about traveling, nature, and the situation in the Doñana National Park. 
            The area has always been dry, but Anna has noticed rain fall has become less and less frequent over the course of her lifetime. Simultaneously water consumption in 
            her hometown has skyrocketed, with second-home owners visiting only in the summer months filling swimming pools and watering lawns all year round.

            <p id="p_blog" class="mt-4">
            Anna is worried about the future of this beautiful national park which is her home, as well as many important species. She wishes there to be more equitable regulations 
            on water use. <a id="home_page_no_registration_card_text" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/10/water-wars-meet-guardians-one-of-europes-vital-wetlands-donana-national-park-spain">You can read in more detail about Doñana National Park here.</a>

                        I discovered also from Anna that the “road” Komoot suggested I could take to avoid the long beach route did not exist. Even if it did, it would be knee 
                        deep in sand also. I had the option of a 30km sandy beach, or a 200km diversion to Seville. I was unhappy with both options. The puncture situation the 
                        previous day had broken my impression I could be completely self sufficient. I had visions of braking down halfway along the beach and the unrelenting tides 
                        coming to gobble me up before I could escape. Anna gave me her number and told me to call if I had any issues: she had friends who worked as park rangers and 
                        she could contact them to help. Her positivity about the beauty of the beach helped me also. Nonetheless I have never been so nervous before a ride as I had 
                        been that morning.

                        I arrived at the beginning of the beach and was greeted by a German tourist (also a cyclist but was dabbling with campavan life) who was very excited to 
                        see me embarking on this challenge. He had done it himself: he was still alive which gave me reassurance. As I was talking to him, two other cycle tourers 
                        arrived onto the beach. They came over and we confirmed we were all taking on the 30km beach. They were happy for me to tag along with them, and I was delighted 
                        to have a small team to go with!

                    Cycling along the beach was nowhere near as bad as the hype on Komoot. In fact, it was much easier than my cycling the day before. I had deflated my tyres 
                    slightly and the wet sand made for a decent surface.

                    I was enjoying being with the couple but they stopping a lot: about every 2 minutes to drink from their water bottles, stretch their legs, or general faffing. 
                    They were also randomly walking sections which were just as ridable as the bits they had just been cycling. It was taking a very long time and I was getting more 
                    and more concerned about being trapped by the tides.

                        Along came another cyclist who stopped to say hello. He was also going to Morocco, and looked a much more proficient cyclist than the couple I was with. 
                        The couple gave their permission to let me go and I happily left them to their fate!

                        In the end it was a fantastic cycle. Me and Ryan chatted the whole way and the time passed quickly. He was heading out to the Atlas mountains as a cycling 
                        photographer for a bike packing race. We had time to chat about all the back stories and meander into a whole range of topics.

                        The end of the beach finally came. We were cycling for about 3 hours solidly after leaving the couple. Thankfully I had lots of bananas I munched on the go. 
                        Even so I was feeling pretty shaky from low sugars at the end: the chatting had distracted me from how tough a cycle it was!

                    <p id="p_blog">
                        At an otherwise unmarked point on the beach was a long bamboo cane stuck into the sand with a Spanish flag flapping about at the top. This was the ferry terminal. 
                        The ferry was sitting in the middle of the estuary looking either side for passengers. We waved and it came over and picked us up and took us to the other side, 
                        about a 1 minute job for €10. Ryan and I continued cycling together until we got to a petrol station with a café where we had some lunch. I ate about 3 baskets of 
                        bread, and they made me an off menu vegan salad. We carried on cycling a bit longer until a point where I saw a decathlon and I went to restock on stove fuel in 
                        preparation for Morocco. I also bought kick stand number three.

                    The mishaps and the unavoidable beach had slowed me down considerably. I conceded to push back my arrival to Morocco from the 1st to the 2nd of February. 
                    I arrived at my final Warm Showers hosts of this leg of the journey the following afternoon, also a day later than I had planned for. Karin and Manu have created 
                    an eco paradise: they had built their own straw insulated home, grew using permaculture techniques, and had so much great food they genourously shared with me 
                    (including a delicious veganified traditional German dish with lentils, vegan Frankfurt and pasta they made for their kids). The couple, and their friend who 
                    lived on site too, were on day five of their ten day fast. I imagine their own kitchen would be torture for them: 
                    <span id="home_page_no_registration_card_text"><strong> filled store cupboards and a fridge with every vegan food you could find in an organic grocery shop. (3)</strong></span>. 
                    However for me after a grueling three and a half days of cycling, I was so grateful to feel refueled and rested.

                    And indeed I needed this rest. My very last day in Europe before reconvening with Zoe was a breathtaking (or breathless) finale. Ryan, who had traveled the same 
                    route the day before, filled me in on the bits to watch out for. I avoided an unrideable section he warned about, but found myself pushing and lifting my bike up 
                    an equally unrideable section for about an hour. I was greeted at the top of the hill by a barbed wire fence and could have cried. Thankfully I found a narrow gap 
                    and squeezed my bike and luggage through separately.

                        The road brought me almost back down to sea level and I had one last big climb. Tarifa, being the windsurfing capital of Spain, lived up to its name: 
                        even the final descent was a strong push against the headwind. I met Zoe on the beach, an hour later than I predicted, and we celebrated our reunion in

                    The shores these two cities can see each other clearly with the naked eye. Yet it felt like being in a new world. There was a free flowing busyness of the 
                    streets at night, people pushing carts of food or random objects on the road alongside the cars. The mingling of smells from open aired evening cafés and spice 
                    stalls with warm coloured powders piled in small pyramids. It was late when we finally found the apartment we were staying at. We had had the sense to save maps of 
                    the city on our phones, but without data we were stuck outside without a way of contacting the host. It was eye opening how dependent we are on mobile internet. 
                    Thankfully our host arrived and let us in and we rested the night.

                    The next morning we bought some Dirhams and went straight to the bus station to catch the eight and a half hour coach to Marrakech. Iz in particular has avoided 
                    long distance coaches for many years: in the UK coach drivers have a particularly hostile approach to bikes, and they nearly always have a bike with them. With CTM 
                    buses in Morocco it is different: you pay a small supplement and can place your bike and luggage upright and tied to a railing in the storage compartment. 
                    A refreshingly stress-free process. To our surprise, the long journey was painless also: I may even go so far as to describe it as pleasant! The coach was impeccably 
                    clean, cool, and peaceful.  <span id="home_page_no_registration_card_text"><strong>CTM buses get a big thumbs up from us (4). </strong></span> Iz appreciated a rest from lugging a heavy bike up hills and along sand also.

                    We arrived in Marrakech in the evening, stayed overnight in a hostel nearby to the bus station, and in the morning hopped back on a nine and a half hour CTM 
                    bus heading out to Bonou, a small village close to M’hamid El Ghizlane. The coach, like the previous day, was very quiet yet almost full. Most people sat silently; 
                    occasionally someone answered the phone. A man in front watched religious chants on TikTok. Two boys about 11 years old in puffer jackets stared out of the windows 
                    to the mountains. A pocket of white people with septum piercings and colourful big seated trousers sat at the front. Women with different coloured hijabs and thick 
                    acrylic jumpers sat together staring ahead in comfortable silence.

                    At sunset two or three people on the coach played prayer calls on their phones. The volume was quiet enough to not be public but loud enough to not be private. 
                    They were about 5 seconds out of sync. A man in a leather jacket front was one of the players; he was slouched in his chair and held his phone out with a tired wrist.

                    The palette of the new landscape was terracotta, greyish greens and all colours in-between. Dust tracks appeared more clearly at twilight - their pattern seems random. 
                    Many of the structures appeared to be made from mud bricks. In the low light we saw people ambling or crouching together in circles in uninhabited areas, surrounded 
                    only by rocks, dust, and occasional shrubs.

                    When we arrived there were nine other volunteers all helping with creating mud bricks, repairing the mud walls, and general housekeeping. 
                    The two of us mainly focussed on building an outdoor shower block by pasting together mud bricks with mud. A few people came and went, 
                    but in general we had a core group. They were like our family whilst we were there.

                    In our first week there we noticed each day became progressively less structured and with less work expected. On Monday just after 10am one of the hosts gently 
                    suggested it was time to start working, which we did. That time was pushed back Tuesday, on Wednesday we decided to start working on our own accord because the 
                    hosts were still asleep. On Thursday work was completely sacked off, and Friday they woke up at about 1pm. Us volunteers were content with this situation. 
                    We had food and free accommodation and plenty of time to chill out together: we huddled around for teachings from Balaint the Enlightened, played cards 
                    (such as Hamza’s “the shitting game”, a variation of “cheat”) and acted out kitchen utensil charades.

                        Paul and Eden hard at work mixing a mudcake for creating new mud bricks. We dug a deep long trench, and refilled it with many buckets of water

                    The second closest town, Tagounite, is 24km away. We visited several times for the souk, the Hammam, or to relax at the other house our hosts owned. 
                    On the first visit Iz and Obiad cycled there and joined the others to look around the souk. Obiad is our oracle for cycling routes around Morocco. 
                    After growing up in Saudi he got a scholarship to study in the US for four years. He was shocked by the food situation there, in particular the choice between 
                    buying food with or without chemicals/pesticides - and if you didn't have the money you didn't have a choice. He changed his course in the second year to study 
                    organic farming and found a permaculture co-operative to live in. He finished his studies last year and cycled with his gravel bike from Oregon to Ecuador. 
                    From there he flew to Morocco where he cycled for several months before stopping a while at the WorkAway. We found out from him that you can get another Moroccan 
                    three month visa simply by being out of the country overnight at the end of the three months - he flew to London and back to Marrakech the next day just to get 
                    another visa. He will make his way to India where he has a job on a permaculture farm lined up later in the year. As we cycled children would run alongside us, 
                    saying bonjour to Iz and salam to Obi. As soon as he speaks they know he is not Moroccan and they guess where. He tells them Yemen (where his mum is from) because 
                    they will ask him for money if he says Saudi.

                    In Bonou it rains about three days a year. On our maps we could see blue lines indicating rivers. These are out of date because they 
                    have now all dried up. Some of the February days were scorching for us, and we had to pace ourselves when doing work out in the sun.

                    When the wind picked up, the dispersed dust made the impression of being in a thick fog: there were days where we avoided going outside because of these 
                    “sandstorms”. The windows of the house were square shaped holes in the walls so all our belongings and blankets would be coated with dust even inside. 
                    Going to the Hamam, the public baths felt marvelous: scrubbed clean and dust free.

                    Sunset was our favourite time of the day: it became cooler and the bleached and beige landscape of the day seemed to come alive with colour. 
                    We walked out into the dunes in a group and watched the sky changing in silence. Other times we did yoga together under the setting sun on the rooftop.

                    On several evenings, musician friends of our hosts were invited and we enjoyed Moroccan music together. The Moroccan men taught us words and phrases in Amazigh 
                    and Darija (Moroccan dialect Arabic). We have collected enough words now for a pleasant 10 second interaction:

                    Towards the end of our time at the WorkAway, we took an overnight trip to “The Real Sahara”. With Hamza's powers of persuasion, all eight volunteers came along, 
                    squeezed into standard sized pickup truck along with the driver, Abdu, and Hamza himself. The dunes at Chigaga were mesmerising. 
                    <span id="home_page_no_registration_card_text"><strong>According to our guide the dunes were 300 metres high in places (6). </strong></span>
                    The two of us and Seba hiked to the closest peak to us, then the next closest, then the very highest peak across the land. 
                    It was like we were soaring above a static pale orange sea under a bright blue sky. Hiking in sand is hard work - it reminded Iz of ascending Mount Toubkal in the 
                    snow, but wearing just socks rather than boots and crampons.

                    This was Iz's camping spot. It was a restless night. A sandstorm started in the early hours of the morning and it was hard to get the right temperature - 
                    we cooked inside our four season sleeping bags, but the wind tried to steal it away if we opened it into a blanket.

                    First thing in the morning we left to escape the storm. We stopped for breakfast at a nomad's house. The driver halted the car right outside the house and honked 
                    repeatedly until the poor nomad was driven out of her house. This seemed quite bizarre - we were just meters away. Perhaps it's a "bring your own doorbell" 
                    system that they use here.

                    On our final day we made one last visit to the Hamam with Eden and Ella. On the way there we hitched a lift to Tagounite in a dustbin lorry 
                    (Trace translation: garbage truck), and on the way back in an ambulance.

                    We both loved our time at the WorkAway, but we had gone past our sell-by-date in the days before leaving. The hosts’ account was being shut down by 
                    WorkAway due to a complaint from a volunteer just before us. Daily dramas were bizarre enough to be amusing in the first week - out of the blue ultimatums, 
                    and the afternoon of Couscous Gate - but felt tiresome by the end. We said our farewells to our global family and took the early morning CTM bus heading back 
                    North West to Ouarzazate.

                    We arrived at Ouarzazate at midday. Zoe posted off a big box of items she no longer needed  
                    <span id="home_page_no_registration_card_text"><strong>- climbing shoes, extra layers, cleats - (7) </strong></span> then we headed to a campsite.

                    We have never been to such a friendly campsite. As we wheeled ourselves in everyone we passed greeted us warmly in their language, 
                    many wanted to know more about us, and an elderly Italian man chatting to us asked if he could have a photo of us to share on Facebook! 
                    We were the only tents in a full site of European retired campavaners.

                    As we searched for a camping spot we were jumped upon by an English (very English) couple. They were incredibly excited when they heard our English accents. 
                    Sean and Susan offered us many cups orange squash and tea. Nothing tasted of England more than hearing them debate over whether Tetley was good enough to offer us. 
                    We pored over their Moroccan map where they recorded their journeys in highlighter pen.

                    We set off cycling the next day after a morning of using all the facilities (wash basins, WiFi, washing lines…). Fifteen kilometres from Ouarzazate we stopped 
                    by Oasis Fint - the first time we had seen running water since arriving in Morocco. Our eyes stunned with the vibrant colours - we hadn't seen this shade of 
                    green in weeks.

                    Other than the oasis, Iz wasn't sold by cycling on this first day. Uphill with a strong headwind in an unchanging Martian landscape. The few indicators we were 
                    still on planet earth were smashed emerald green glass, and Coca-Cola bottles half filled with straw coloured liquid. As we are our stove dinner (millet couscous 
                    and rehydrated soya mince) in an intrusive wind, Iz [writing in third person] was feeling especially mardy: 
                    <span id="home_page_no_registration_card_text"><strong>they even questioned what the point of cycling was when there were perfectly good buses (8). </strong></span>
                    Whilst eating we were asked to move by a man in a pickup truck - it was forbidden to camp in this uninhabited nomansland apparently. 
                    We packed up and carried along the road until we found a new spot. It was windfree and peaceful. Things happen for a reason.

                    After a good night's sleep the landscape appeared more beautiful - big red striated hills, small yellow gorse like flowers by the side of the road, 
                    flurries of chipmunks. The journey was coming alive, and became filled with lovely human interactions.

                    Within an hour of cycling uphill it was easy to overheat. We were grateful to a motorbiker who stopped to give us a bottle of sparkling mineral water. 
                    He had come from Ireland and had been shaken the previous day from falling off his (very expensive BMW) motorbike on an off-road section. With no signal in 
                    the middle of nowhere he was grateful he had managed to get himself back to the road: it had involved lifting the bike and luggage (300kg in total) up out of 
                    the ditch it landed in.

                    Next we stopped at a service station: a shelter made with long sticks and ripped cloth where a man sells vegetables, fruit, dates, and nuts to passing trade.

                    Soon afterwards we were passing a construction site and we were called to join them for lunch - a big clay dish of couscous. The workers squated around and ate by 
                    rolling the food into a ball in their right hand. They started to peel off and we were assured by the manager that there was no one else left to eat the rest other 
                    than us. Absolutely delicious! We avoided the bits of lamb and he asked if we were vegetarian. We replied yes and he gave a big belly laugh and then a high five to

                    On the same day we found ourselves invited for a second couscous lunch, this time by an all female rug making cooperative. We had misinterpreted their sign for a 
                    grocery store, and we were confused to find ourselves in a room full of women weaving on looms. After eating we were shown the process of making the rugs - sheep's 
                    wool is combed then spun into thread on a thin cone, twirled with another thread to double it, and then woven, and then dyed with natural colours.

                    <p id="p_blog">
                    One of our main concerns about cycling in Morocco was access to drinking water. In fact, in our first stretch of the journey it was easier than Europe to 
                    find water even in remote places. Very frequently by the roadside there is a tap against a tiled wall, sometimes with some painted pastel coloured car tyres 
                    to be used as seats by the side. The next morning as we had run out of water after breakfast this lovely well appeared within minutes of cycling.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p_blog">
                    Stopping to sort out adjustments with Zoe's saddle by a cluster of houses, a woman and her toddler gazed on at us. The woman used the toddler's hand to wave to 
                    us and we waved back. More people emerged from neighbouring doors and the toddler toddled over to them and received hugs. An elderly man across the road approached 
                    and gestured to ask if we would like tea: 🤙 then tilt the thumb backwards. We had only recently had lunch but we were very happy to accept the offer. Bread and 
                    olive oil was brought out too, along with another man who sat with us who smiled shyly with sidewards facing teeth and his gaze towards the floor. We sat in silence 
                    mostly as he could only speak Amazigh and the elderly man who spoke French had disappeared. The bread was wonderful - crispy and doughy - and the olive oil had a 
                    lovely taste.

                    As evening started closing in we kept an eye out for secluded places to set our tents. On our way to our camping spot we came across a shepherd. 
                    He was sitting amongst a pile of stones in one of the traditional khaki brown djellaba with a pointed hood. He welcomed us warmly to his patch of stones 
                    and offered us water to drink. He gestured to ask us where we were going and we gestured "là-bas" up the featureless hillside. He nodded as if he agreed this 
                    was a perfectly normal place to be heading, and wished us a bon voyage.

                    We reached the top where we were out of site of the road and started cooking. Half an hour later the shepherd came into view again, greeted us warmly, and gave 
                    us a sprig of herbs to be used for tea which we had picked from the hillside. It smelt like thyme to us. We invited him to join us which we thought he had accepted 
                    so we started chopping a few more things. "Mheba", welcome, I said as he sat down. "Mheba pourquoi?" He replied. He started standing up and then waved to say goodbye 
                    and wandered back down the hill.

                    <p id="p_blog">
                    Another 10 minutes later he re-emerged again, this time gesturing down the hill "Mon Maison" which we took as an offer to visit. We were still in the midst of 
                    cooking on two stoves and chopping vegetables and we tried to ask if we could come after the food. He nodded and then headed yet again back down the hill. 
                    We discussed together and decided we would take up an offer of somewhere to stay. Zoe got up to look where he was going but he was already out of sight. 
                    Oh well, we thought, and began tucking into our stove cooked meal.

                    Another 15 minutes passed when a younger man emerged, casually walking up the hill. He greeted us warmly - the son of the shepherd was sent as he could speak some 
                    French. He sat down with us and we offered him a portion of our millet couscou, soya mince, and beetroot mush and he politely accepted. He ate with us for a while, 
                    finding a small patch of common ground with French, and then signaled he had had enough of the meal. We packed the rest in a tupperware, and descended together.

                    Down the gravel track, crossing the tarmac road, and along a dusty lane we came to a cluster of houses. The shepherd was there (Taleeb) and welcomed us like 
                    old friends. Many children ran about and adults waved and greeted us as we arrived with our bikes. The big extended family lives together in neighbouring houses - 
                    the grandma and grandad, three (possibly four) sons, two with wives and the other son who had brought us down the hill, and about 8 grandchildren who all play 
                    together.

                    They had a very large garden growing olives, saffron, almonds, dates, carob pods, and more. A solar panel generates electricity to draw water up and into a small 
                    reservoir. They have chickens, a couple of cows, a small sheep, and a dejected looking donkey who resigns itself to a life nuzzling in the stones with many children 
                    jumping on his back, pulling his ears, and grabbing his bottom lip all while he stands still staring blankly ahead. The grandmother makes butter, and collects wheat 
                    and goes through grain by grain to remove bits of straw.

                    Eating times in Morocco remind me of the part in Lord of the Rings where Merry and Pippin describe the essential meals of the day: breakfast at anytime with 
                    amlou (any kind of sweetened nut butter, sometimes with oil added such as argan) and olive oil, a second breakfast at 12pm of exactly the same, lunch at about 3pm 
                    (such as cous cous), snacks sometime in the afternoon (almonds from the garden on that day), bread again with olive oil and melted butter and cake at about 7pm, 
                    and dinner (such as tagine) any time after 10pm and could be well later.

                    We stayed for two nights to give us a rest from cycling and enjoyed the company of the family. Zoe went with Hamid to explore an ancient site with houses built 
                    into the walls. Iz rested at home, <span id="home_page_no_registration_card_text"><strong>recovering from being spiked with milk (10) </strong></span> and trying to finish off the admin for the Swedish visa appeal whilst navigating many

                            (10) From my rapid decline over the course of the evening and the event over the course of the night, I think we can say it's official: Iz is lactose

                    It took us two more days until we reached Taroudant. Overnight we slept in an abandoned building (an excellent find by Zoe) and had headwind and traffic as we 
                    approached the city - exhausting work. We saw our first orange trees which was a surprise in a barren landscape with very little being grown for food. 
                    After this orange plantation many more followed. The landscape was transforming - green farmland as far as the eye could see. We paused a while under a shelter 
                    by a tap and was joined by an elderly woman who was walking back from the shops. She gave us an apple each, and then half a baguette. Zoe was gathering up our 
                    rubbish and the woman beckons over her shoulder: "just lob it, no one cares, just lob it" she seemed to be saying in Darija. Zoe looked perplexed and before we 
                    knew it the woman took the bag of litter out of her hands and gently threw it over her shoulder where it joined a small assortment of other unwanted items at the 
                    foot of a bush. She turned to smile at us as if to say "there you go". We glanced at each other, both feeling strangely sad and confused about what to do. 
                    Litter is everywhere here. As it would be in Europe too if we didn't ship it off to other countries.

                    Finally we arrived at Houdaifa’s house in Taroudant where we will sign out for this blog post. Finishing writing now, we are actually in Tafraoute, but we 
                    will save the descriptions of these two cities and all the places in between for next time! Over and out!
